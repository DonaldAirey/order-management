			Thank you for your order of Teraque&#39;s <b>Explorer Chrome Suite</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
			license file is attached to this message.&nbsp;&nbsp;The installation package comes
			with an evaluation license, but you will want to place the license file in the directory
			where the Teraque libraries are installed in order to unlock the full license.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
			Visual Studio IDE will compile the license(s) into the runtime version for your
			customers when you add the <b>licenses.licx</b> to your target project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make
			sure that you place this file in the <b>Properties</b> directory of your target
			project and set the build action to <b>Embedded Resource</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can
			find an example <b>licenses.licx</b> in the <b>Explorer Chrome Example</b> sample
			project that comes with the download package.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can download your product
			from:
